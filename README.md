This repository showcases an end-to-end QA Automation project created to demonstrate industry-standard testing practices using Selenium WebDriver with Java.

The project covers the complete software testing lifecycle, starting from
requirement analysis and test planning to manual test case design, automation implementation, and CI/CD execution.

The SauceDemo web application is used as the test application to simulate
real-world e-commerce testing scenarios.
